This directory should contain an encrypted SSL .crt file (such as sampledomain1_com.crt.vault) and an encrypted
SSL .key file (such as sampledomain1_com.key.vault).  Both .vault files should be encrypted using ansible-vault
using the same password as used for other .vault and vault.yml files across this Ansible script set.
